Wireless communication involves the transmission of
information over a distance without the help of wires,
cables or any other forms of electrical conductors.
Wireless communication is done by transmitting data
through electromagnetic wave such as Radio Waves,
Microwaves, X rays , UV rays etc. The most common
wireless technologies use radio wavesed across an area
to monitor and record environmental conditions like temperature,
humidity, and motion. These sensors communicate wirelessly and 
send data to a central base station (BS) for processing. 


What is Wireless Network ?
A wireless network is a system that connects devices
(such as computers, smartphones, printers, etc.) to each
other and to the internet without using physical cables.
Wireless networks are convenient as they eliminate the
need for physical cables, allowing devices to
communicate over distances and offering greater
mobility.
