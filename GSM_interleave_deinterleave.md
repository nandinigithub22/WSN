In GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), interleaving and deinterleaving are techniques used to protect data against errors that occur during transmission over a wireless channel. 

# Interleaving
Interleaving is a process of rearranging the data sequence in a specific pattern before transmission. The main goal is to spread out the bits of data in such a way that bursts of errors that occur during transmission affect the data in a more uniform and distributed manner, making error correction more effective. Here's how it works:

Input Data: The data to be transmitted is divided into smaller blocks.
Reordering: The bits within each block are reordered according to a specific interleaving pattern.
Transmission: The reordered data is then transmitted over the channel.
The interleaving process helps to ensure that errors, which often occur in bursts, are spread out across multiple blocks of data rather than being concentrated in one block. This makes it easier for the error correction algorithms to detect and correct errors.

# Deinterleaving
Deinterleaving is the reverse process of interleaving. It involves rearranging the received data bits back to their original order after they have been received. This process is necessary to correctly interpret the received data. Here's how it works:

Received Data: The received data is taken in the interleaved order.
Reordering: The bits are reordered according to the inverse of the interleaving pattern used during transmission.
Output Data: The original data sequence is reconstructed.
By deinterleaving the received data, the original structure of the data is restored, making it possible to apply error correction and retrieve the transmitted information accurately.
